    <br><p>Man of faith, observer of nature and great architect, Antoni Gaudí has become a universal figure of modern architecture. His contribution to the discipline was a break from the established order, as much in form as for the structure and constructive solutions found in his buildings, a result of his own, unique and unprecedented methodology.</p>

    <h4>Brief biography:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1852</b> Born in Reus (Catalonia), son of a coppersmith, he spent a big part of his childhood in the countryside. Frequent contact with nature stimulated two of the abilities which were to become crucial in the development of his work: the observation and meticulous analysis of the natural world.</li>
      <li><b>1867</b> During his adolescence, Gaudí formed a strong friendship with two of his fellow pupils at the Piarist School in Reus, also enthusiastic about nature and very fond of going on excursions. On one of these outings, they reached the ruins of the Santa María de Poblet monastery. The three youths made a resolution to restore the ancient building, although, of that enthusiastic youthful project, all that remains is a floor plan drawn by Gaudí, who must have been about 15 at the time, and a note written by his companions. For Gaudí, that experience was undoubtedly the declaration of his vocation as an architect.</li>
      <li><b>1868</b> Gaudí moved to Barcelona to study the final year of his secondary education and to do the foundation course at the School of Architecture. From early on in his studies, the brilliant architect was hard at work in the studios of eminent professors and masters of the craft.</li>
      <li><b>1878</b> After qualifying in Architecture, he received his first official commission for <a href="http://casavicens.org/?lang=en" target="_blank">Casa Vicens</a>. As his professional reputation grew he undertook larger projects commissioned by the bourgeoisie such as, amongst others, the <a href="http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/wv3/en/page/749/casa-calvet.html?" target="_blank">Casa Calvet</a>, the <a href="https://www.casabatllo.es/en/" target="_blank">Casa Batlló</a> and the Casa Milà a.k.a. the <a href="https://www.lapedrera.com/en/home" target="_blank">Pedrera</a>. In 1883 he took over the design of the <a href="http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/" target="_blank">Sagrada Familia</a>, while also working on other projects.</li>
      <li><b>1910</b> A major exhibition of Gaudí’s work opened in the Gran Palais in Paris, and this was the only exhibition outside of Spain dedicated to the architect during his lifetime.</li>
      <li><b>1926</b> Gaudí was hit by a tram on June 7. The condition of the architect was quite serious after the accident, and he died three days later from the injuries. He was then 74 years old. His funeral cortege, which went through much of Barcelona and finished in the Sagrada Familia, was a grand event in the city in recognition of his status as the greatest architect Barcelona has ever seen. Gaudí was buried in the chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the crypt of the Sagrada Familia.</li>
